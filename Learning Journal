Watched the videa to get an understanding of how a 2d game works
The rest was done from previous knowledge

Attacks:
created enemy attacks
redid the player attacks
learned from Jonathan how to destroy objects and how to rodate them
Also learned how to use a timer

Did some polishing
learned how to have the character move with the attack when in the air
added colors to the stage

I plan on making some final changes like music and intro then I'll help Jonathan with his solo project
